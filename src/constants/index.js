The basis of my new idea is still the brain. The soundtrack is intended to represent the brain in a simplified way as a working machine. The viewer will be guided through the individual areas of the brain, which are audio-visually encapsulated from each other. Basically, each area has a similar process but still differs from each other in some details.",

So this gave me already a feeling for atmosphere and how a track can progress in its mood. To prepare even more for my own creation, I listened again to some of Hans Zimmer's famous tracks, but also to some smaller composers which make their music without any context to films. While listening to the music, I tried to not just get the mood from the music, but also tried to figure out the specific elements that convey the different moods, e.g. tempo, choice of instruments, sound effects. I then incorporated some of the ideas in my own track. While the music is inspired by various film scores, the visuals are inspired by the classic simple look you can find at different music visualizers. Everything was done from scratch, no music loops and no pre-rendered images.",

I was intrigued and decided to pursue implementing it in p5. I connected the graphics and audio parts by modulating the values of these variables using the audio signals, resulting in some very interesting emergent behavior. In some ways, this magic formula connects to the mathematical side of the audio I was recording, in that seemingly very complex and varied phenomena can be described and broken down into a relatively elegant looking formula (or maybe they’re all just sine waves after all...).",

I implemented different RenderPasses and wrote a small shader file for creating a Gridplane but unfortunately i had many difficulties making the shaders work and also didn't find much information online how to implement external shader files into a Three.js scene. After many unsuccessfull tries I decided to switch back to p5.js and create a new scene. I started with a Terrain-Grid which i created by looping through vertices with a for() function for rows and columns. I then added some noise on each vertex creating the wave effect. In addition I created an Array with different blue colors which fill the grid making it appear as water. Afterwards I added a sun which was also created with a for() function drawing many ellipses on the same spot with growing sizes and lerping through 2 color schemes. Finally I select a column range on the Terrain Grid and changed the color to a yellow color which represents the suns reflection.",

This should be represented both in a musical and also visual way. At the beginning there is a lot of chaos, disruption and anarchy in mind. No clear thoughts are manifesting. Small ideas rise are beeing processed, rated, compete with each other and most of the time they are discounted. Doubt comes into play and blocks an effective developement and structuring these rising thoughts and ideas. This process of unease and unsetteledness takes place over a longer period of time and increases its weight. After some time this process gets out of hand and inside of this chaos there are small structured forms visible and they are entangling from within the chaos and start to make sense from the inner core of chaotic cloud.`,

    title: "Origami Clouds / a weird muesli morning",
    artist: "Johanna Hartmann",
    subtitle: "audiovisual sketch",
    short_description:
      "My idea was to create a morning feeling with the piece, using only sounds recorded while making cereal. It starts with a quiet, strange sound. More and more sounds emerge and it becomes a bit more abstract. The sounds build up for a while until the noises stop and all you hear is the loud scraping of the spoon. From then on, a second, more rhythmic part kicks in. This is supposed to be the more active part of the morning, where you get into your routine and just act. From time to time the rhythm is interrupted by something slightly unexpected - like a real morning. Towards the end, the rhythm is interrupted more and more and turns into a strange, broken sound. At the end, all you hear is a slamming and the sad sound of a scraping spoon. This is the moment when you close the door and start the day. For my piece music concrète, I recorded sounds made while eating cereal in the morning. I didn't use any food sounds. Instead, I tried to capture all the other sounds that might not be so obvious. These included throwing cereal into a bowl, shaking it in the box, using different types and different textures of cereal, including muesli and oats. I recorded a 'clink' sound that a cereal made when it touched the ceramic bowl. I also recorded the opening of a milk bottle, the scratching of the surface of the bowl with a spoon, the pouring of milk around the cereal, the closing of the fridge and a voice that occurred randomly during the recording (the 'aaahhh' sound). I cut these samples into small pieces and selected the most appropriate ones. I removed the noise that was in the background with EQ subtraction. I also pitched some sounds and added reverb to the sound. For the drum part, I pitched the sounds and cut them to have the appropriate diamond shape. From the pling sound, I created a virtual MIDI controller and played some semi-harmonic keys. I experimented with putting the sounds together in different ways to create this abstract to rhythmic to abstract story. I also added automation to most of the samples and mixed the channels so that a spatial sound developed. All in all, the process was challenging for me as I had no previous experience of producing such a song and it was difficult to get the samples where I wanted them.",

    short_description:
      "I really like the work by Tyler Hobbs, especially his algorithmic approach to astehtically pleasing triangle subdivison. The thing I dislike was that the entire process is more or less a blackbox of randomness with no way to interfer as an artist (who the actual artist is is a different question in that regard). So I wanted to develop some sort of hybrid application with most of the features Hobbs' algorithm uses, but also the ability for the user to interfer at any time and change the outcome more to his liking. For the implementation I used p5.js because of it's simplicity and relative ease for developing such a graphical application. The triangles are stored as objects with both their respective vector and their fill color. When adding a triangle, a new triangle object is created, using the two closest vertices and the vertice at the new (mouse) position). When subdividing, the cross product of the longest side of the triangle is used as a new vector, in combination with the rest of the points, two new triangle objects are created. When filling a triangle, the triangle object the mouse is in, gets a new fill color set. One big thing learning with this project was the sheer complexity something 'simple' as a polygon add in common 3D programs must have as well as how all the different product of vectors are can be used to create asthetically pleasing picture with math.",

      "The Question behind my coding project is, how to visualize music? So the question was what does music look like? How can sounds be interpreted visually? Of course there is no personal answer to this and also the feeling that music belongs to every track and genre. An interesting thought here for was from Edmund Husserl: We only perceive the present tone, the respective tone 'now'; the sound of the previous notes is really just a memory. To visualize this idea of understanding music, I decided to use the Fast Fourier transformation (FFT). The FFT detects the audio signal and converts it into a spectrum of values (amplitudes). The Frequency range as the respective amplitudes are mapped to the grid and show the time based changes of the song. So I can not only see the tone-”now”, there are all further tones. The generated grid translates the music in a three dimensional moving landscape.",

    subtitle: "audiovisual sketch",
    short_description: `Noticing that my aesthetic resembled a dark 'origami' I wanted to combine my two projects. The pulsing behavior of the "squeezebox" also reminded me of electronic music. I then used the EDM Track "Hero" from Infected Mushroom, because it has a very ominous and aggressive feel similar to the visuals. While listening to it, I found some similarities in the dramaturgy between the song and my sonic pi composition. So I removed the flute from my own composition, to avoid melodic conflicts and mixed the audio tracks together in what resulted in the highly blasphemous creation "hero of kyoto". A beat-detection function was used to spawn new vertices, making the structure grow over the stretch of the music. Also, since processing renders the "real" filled-in geometry (in the fragment shader) and the stroke separately I did not do any changes in the vertex shader because the Aesthetic of the work heavily relies on the line-work. I decided to add one more interactive component and passed the middle fft-range to the fragment shader and experimented with it a bit. I combined the two color layers so that, when the music was quite, the color was homogeneous and when it peaked it was light, revealing the second layer. This resembled a soul-like force embedded in the shape, which fit the theme. I then had to adapt the colors a bit and settled on the final dark 'origami' Squeeze box with red outlines.`,

  description:
    "The master program Creative Technologies combines audio-visual media technologies and software development studies with an artistic-creative exploration of novel forms of expression in film and digital media art. Creative-artistic computer scientists as well as technically oriented media designer come together in the context of the Film University to experiment with technology, creativity and film with an interdisciplinary approach. Focus are all mechanisms that contribute to the magic of movies: from graphics, sound and visual effects over traditional production processes to novel forms of storytelling in XR (Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, Augmented Reality), cross-media, and interactive. The long history of the Film University Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF and its fundamental values and resources offer the first steps of a successful career. As part of a university, which teaches film practices but is equally research oriented, the master program Creative Technologies is unique in Germany.",
