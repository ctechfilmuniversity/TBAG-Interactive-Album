For me it was the first sound project and therefore I had difficulties to express the different feelings through sound. Especially the transition between the different emotions didn't really work. The basis of my new idea is still the brain. The soundtrack is intended to represent the brain in a simplified way as a working machine. The viewer will be guided through the individual areas of the brain, which are audio-visually encapsulated from each other. Basically, each area has a similar process but still differs from each other in some details.",

    short_description: "Dark Chaos is an atmospheric and cinematic project. Even before this project, I admired the music in films and always chose music for my own short films / videos very carefully. So this gave me already a feeling for atmosphere and how a track can progress in its mood. To prepare even more for my own creation, I listened again to some of Hans Zimmer's famous tracks, but also to some smaller composers which make their music without any context to films. While listening to the music, I tried to not just get the mood from the music, but also tried to figure out the specific elements that convey the different moods, e.g. tempo, choice of instruments, sound effects. I then incorporated some of the ideas in my own track. While the music is inspired by various film scores, the visuals are inspired by the classic simple look you can find at different music visualizers. Everything was done from scratch, no music loops and no pre-rendered images.",

    short_description: "In researching ways to implement the code, I came across the aptly named “super formula” - a discovery by Johan Gielis in the year 2000, which can surprisingly create a huge number of shapes, in 2D and, in a modified form, in 3D by just changing 6 variables in the equation. I was intrigued and decided to pursue implementing it in p5. I connected the graphics and audio parts by modulating the values of these variables using the audio signals, resulting in some very interesting emergent behavior. In some ways, this magic formula connects to the mathematical side of the audio I was recording, in that seemingly very complex and varied phenomena can be described and broken down into a relatively elegant looking formula (or maybe they’re all just sine waves after all...).",

    short_description: "My main idea was to create a RetroWave/Synthwave scene with Three.js using different shaders and post-processing. I implemented different RenderPasses and wrote a small shader file for creating a Gridplane but unfortunately i had many difficulties making the shaders work and also didn't find much information online how to implement external shader files into a Three.js scene. After many unsuccessfull tries I decided to switch back to p5.js and create a new scene. I started with a Terrain-Grid which i created by looping through vertices with a for() function for rows and columns. I then added some noise on each vertex creating the wave effect. In addition I created an Array with different blue colors which fill the grid making it appear as water. Afterwards I added a sun which was also created with a for() function drawing many ellipses on the same spot with growing sizes and lerping through 2 color schemes. Finally I select a column range on the Terrain Grid and changed the color to a yellow color which represents the suns reflection.",

    artist: "Malte Hillebrand",
    subtitle: "audiovisual sketch",
    short_description: "I really like the work by Tyler Hobbs, especially his algorithmic approach to astehtically pleasing triangle subdivison. The thing I dislike was that the entire process is more or less a blackbox of randomness with no way to interfer as an artist (who the actual artist is is a different question in that regard). So I wanted to develop some sort of hybrid application with most of the features Hobbs' algorithm uses, but also the ability for the user to interfer at any time and change the outcome more to his liking. For the implementation I used p5.js because of it's simplicity and relative ease for developing such a graphical application. The triangles are stored as objects with both their respective vector and their fill color. When adding a triangle, a new triangle object is created, using the two closest vertices and the vertice at the new (mouse) position). When subdividing, the cross product of the longest side of the triangle is used as a new vector, in combination with the rest of the points, two new triangle objects are created. When filling a triangle, the triangle object the mouse is in, gets a new fill color set. One big thing learning with this project was the sheer complexity something 'simple' as a polygon add in common 3D programs must have as well as how all the different product of vectors are can be used to create asthetically pleasing picture with math.",

Creative-artistic computer scientists as well as technically oriented media designer come together in the context of the Film University to experiment with technology, creativity and film with an interdisciplinary approach. Focus are all mechanisms that contribute to the magic of movies: from graphics, sound and visual effects over traditional production processes to novel forms of storytelling in XR (Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, Augmented Reality), cross-media, and interactive. The long history of the Film University Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF and its fundamental values and resources offer the first steps of a successful career. As part of a university, which teaches film practices but is equally research oriented, the master program Creative Technologies is unique in Germany.",
