The Project online: https://editor.p5js.org/lenappss/sketches/C--CcTiOd

#### Oultine of the idea:

Initially my idea was to a generative A/V "cityscape" using different technics in mapping of generative sound and image, but because this kind of project would take much more time and research I ended up making a short audio visual sketch that with a lot imagination could resemble mention cityscape. 

#### Technical choices:

for sound design I chose PureData and its library Automatonism. I used different sound synthesis techniques on very basic level, also effects , generative sequencing  and sampling (samples recorded in Berlin). For visual part in p5.js I used besides p5 functions and object also shader coding (GLSL) for lighting and library for java script called Bandaloo (https://github.com/bandaloo/post5) for post-effects.  For audio visual reactivity I used Sound library in p5: FFT and amplitude level.

#### Artistic intention:

It supposed to be a representation of dark industrial urban environment. I am planning to develop  that idea further in the future.

#### Learnings and reflections:

What I found challenging and also curious is thinking about the ways of mapping sound to image so it would not be straight forward and clumsy, I could not resolve this problem during this project but exited  to work and experiment on it further in my future projects. And beside that as always a challenge to "art-control" noise (sound or image).
