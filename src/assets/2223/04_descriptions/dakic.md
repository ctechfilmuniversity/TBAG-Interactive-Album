# Final Project: Struggle

## Idea

I want to create two parallel digital beings that exsist next to each other.
The peaceful and an agressive one. They should be confronting each other through audio and visual contrasts, and agressive one should overtake the other one, but on the end I would like the balance and synergy to prevail.
#
## Technical Choices

For the audio part, after trying to create something in Ableton, I decided to focus more time on learning p5.js and programming in general. That is why I decided to create a track in FruityLoops, with which I am already familiar.

I know that I want a simplistic and minimal track, which will also enable me to cover up my lack of programming knowledge.

My decision was to create one track, but export them separately as stems and load many of them in p5 separately. This enables me to have greater control over mapping the parameters of each part to its corresponding visuals.

Each track has its different visual techique. 
  * One is a simple 3D geometry with lights and translation
  * The other is a simple particle system filled with black color

The goal was that they should also cancel each other in a way, but was chalenging is to have an option to be displayed together.
## Artistic Intention
#
I wanted to represent a sharp-cutting duality between two different systems, both visualy and musicaly. Non-smooth switching between the two should represent their differences and conflict.

The end should show a way to find peace between two opposing beings.

## Learnings and Reflection
#
The proccess was far more complicated than I excpected and I wish I started to work on it earlier, because I feel I didn't make myself enough space to experiment and realize my Artistic intention.

Learning p5.js as my very first programming language to actually use in real-life was the greatest benefit of the final project, for me. The whole process of learning, reusing code, debuging, finding a way to embody my idea was very exciting and frustrating, in a good way. I feel like came closer to understanding the way to think while programing and I would like to continue working on this. p5 offers an insight at the abstraction of though and it has realtime visual feedback as a platform to experiment. I like that.

This inspired me to learn programming and find ways to achieve all these things easily.

If I was to do it again, I would
* Make a track in Ableton
* Start earlier
