# **Space Lofi - sounds and visuals**

**Tbag #1 semester project**

## brief outline of the idea

The project is a lofi sound visual atmospheric scenario.
I've taken inspiration from the existing Lofi aesthetics, which have many subgenres, and chosen to focus on spacy lofi.

I didn't have a finished idea in mind when I started the project, but the graphic I had to combine with the music I created led me to create a dessert/mars scenario.

as the sounds are taken from my daily life (street music, phone call from my mom, birds from the balcony, and a busy street) I've decided to use all of the as some sort of an area 55 desert communication station.

The scene is empty of biological life, it has only machinery, but then everything in there testifies to their existence.

Are there people nearby? are we in a Mars colony? Or all of those signs are just empty objects and far signals that arrived traveling empty in space thousands of years after humanity already ceased to exist?

### description of the technical choices

- For graphics, I have used P5 as we learned in class.
  I enjoyed using it, as it is a very intuitive and simplified form of JS which is surprisingly friendly for sounds reactive graphics.

- I chose to load OBJ objects, it was an aesthetic choice but I also enjoyed learning how to combine ready-made graphics (which I sometimes produce myself) with JS.

- For sound, I have used Abelton live 11. I am familiar with the program, but as a nonmusician, I have never had the chance to work on it. It is very complex and has many features, but I managed to create decent sounds. I was also happy to work on a program that is made in Kreuzberg!

### description of the artistic intention

- My starting point for the project was Lofi aesthetic. I like this style because it has not only distinctive sounds but also interesting visuals to pair with.

- As a visual person it was easy to start with the graphic part of the work. I wanted to use the Lofi twilight color scheme which combines soft colors and neon purple/blue.

- At first, I used 2D visuals, as seen in sketch 1, but later on, I decided to use only obj 3d objects. Working with 3D is much more challenging for me and I used it as a learning experience, but I also liked the visual language, and desert/mars vibe, that I've created.

- Creating the sound was much more challenging, as I have 0 previous experience, but it was very interesting to try and I hope to keep on working with Abelton in the future.

### learnings and reflections

- This is the project I've worked on most of all semester. I also enjoyed it the most.

- I am still not 100% happy with the result, I know it could have been better, but I needed some distance from it after all this work and I will return to improve it in the future.

- Working with p5js was not very challenging, as I've worked with JS in the past, therefor I've put my effort to explore 3D which I have no experience with.

- 3D is hard but very rewarding. I need to learn more about how to work better and smarter with the 3-dimensional grid system.

- Working with Ableton live was very challenging. I would actually prefer to learn it much more in detail. I have little music experience I could benefit from learning the program in a more detailed way.

- I enjoyed very making my own sound and I would be happy to do it again in the future.

- sounds visualization:
  Only after creating the sounds and the visuals I've combined them together, and once I did it I understood how much potential it has.
  If I tried combining visuals and sound before creating all graphics, I believe I could have had a more interesting result, but by the time I did it, I didn't want to change everything all over again.
