I took this project as a opportunity to learn more about fragment shaders.
My goal was to create an animation similar to oil flowing on a water surface, which I achieved using fractal brownian motion and domain warping.
I added some of the shaders I created along the way for the outro to put together a strange testscreen.
The amplitude of the track modulates a multiplier inside the fbm function and the amplitude of the domain warping function.

The musical accompaniment is still unfinished and I'll return to it later.
The vocal snippets were sampled from [this video by Vocal Synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h56WLqdD-7I). The sounds were created using Ableton Wavetable, Ableton stock effects, Iris 2, Arcade and Stutter Edit 2. 

For more detailed information and my other references, please check out my comments in the code.
