# A TRIP DOWN THE SUPERMARKET

This project came to life due to an early COVID-19 symptom.

## Project Description

*A TRIP DOWN THE SUPERMARKET* explores perspectives on supermarkets and the temporality of life. 
A mixture of alternate reality, surrealism and the superfulousness of a supermarket driven world, create a harmonic and hypnotic audiovisual interraction.

I went to Edeka Market next to my home where I started hearing drones and sounds in tune and in rhythm. I felt like I was there and at the same time I was not, like I was in a different universe and got lost in the sounds of the supermarket (from freezers to heatintg devices to people, register machines, coins, etc...). 

## Sound

### Artistic Intention

The soundscape was designed to reacreate the way I explored the sounds in the supermarket, passing by multiple elements with noises that for some reason don't sound totally disturbing.
I wanted to try new things in relation to sound and one of the was using location-recordings, as I always record things but never use them. Then, I tried to simulate these with musical sounds and combine the *noise* with the *music*.
While editing, the sound of the cashiere reminded me a lot to the hospital monitor sound. This is how the second layer of the storyline was added. 

### Technical Choices

After my trip at the supermarket, I started with working on a pre-built drone in Serum (VC Cyber Didjiridoo) by changing a number of parameters until I could execute the rythm and tonality I had set in mind for this journey and I did the same for the kick, also in Serum. After that I had the goal of shaping my recording into a 2/3 minute video so I worked on my supermarket recordings to build a more concise idea and then I started to experiment.
Then I went on to search for a few extra supermarket samples that I didn't manage to record well which I also had in mind.
After that it began the most harduous part of the project due to editing all of the different samples into a more consise and evolving idea. By adding a mix of reverb and delay effects to different tracks, I managed to construct the buildup I had set in mind, editing the sample waves into small chuncks of little edited samples in order to play around with them as I saw fit (by going up and down the tracks with different effects). I also changed the delay settings and worked with the reverb to give it the sustain I wanted and spent a great deal of time editing the volume on several tracks in order to have better buildup and dynamics.
After having a more completed project (closer to what I had in mind) I decided to enrich the base drone with another one so I went on to garage band on my Ipad and made a progressive drone with one of its Synths and connected it to the ending portion of the "dead" beep, and I also added some more background money machines because why not.
at the very end I added an AI vst to the master track I had found on the reaper subreddit that helps compress the "main out" for me called "smart:comp".

## Graphics

### Artistic Intention

For the visuals, I wanted to create a cluttery atmosphere that synchronises with the trance created by the sound. 
While following the visuals, the viewer should feel sucked inside the surreal alternative world. It should create enjoyment but as well be disturbing and overwhelming due to the amount of information.

### Technical Choices

I chose to work with P5 and create interactivity between the graphics and the song. 

## Learnings and Reflections

I can say that it was an amazing learning experience that I enjoyed a lot, eventually.
For the audio, I never used Reaper or Serum before and I always wanted to explore them. As well, field-recording was always something I was interested in, and even if I haven't used in this project as much as I actually had recorded for this project (I changed my ideas about 3-4 times), I learned a lot about it.
Furthermore without doubt, even if my animations are simple, I am very proud of them. Few months ago, I didn't know this exists!
