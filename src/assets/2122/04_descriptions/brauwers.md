My project is inspired by the phenomena of glitches in combination with a mellow pop track. The idea came about while experiencing real shader glitches in the process of developing a blob. The audio is inspired by pop music and partially reminds me of one track in the movie It Follows.

## Technical Choices
### Audio
I never had any contact with audio production and after trying different DAWs I chose to work with Ableton. Compared to the others Ableton was the easiest to understand and get into, also the GUI is the most appealing to me. I mostly used Abletons library, I just added some kicks and snares.

### Graphics
I chose to work with p5 and shaders because I wanted to get more into shader programming. I think visually shaders extend the potential of what I did with p5 previously by a lot. I worked with existing shaders that I adjusted to my needs.

## Artistic Intention

### Audio
My plan approaching creating an audio track for the first time was to use my favorite parts of some of my favorite songs, which are all in the genre of alternative & pop. I experimented with instruments, melodies and chords from these parts of the songs and used the results that I enjoyed. The outcome sounds almost nothing like the inspirations which is an intersting realization for me. My taste of sound in the moment of producing the track influenced the result heavily. 


### Graphics
Visually my initial plan was to create a blob that is changed (morphing or dissolving) through music. Because of the previously described glitch my plan became to get a similar glitch effect intentionally. The blob dissolves into particles and apparently dances around itself while always going back to its inital form. The animation is mainly influenced by the music and lightly by time.

## Learings & Reflection
### Audio
Since I never created a song, everything we leaned in class and everything I learned while creating the song was new to me. I think it's exciting that I'm now able to create music, even though I know there is extremely much that I don't know or understand yet. But this was a great starting point and having a song as a result is very motivating. Previously I thought I couldn't do it because it was a whole other world of creative work that I don't know anything about. Knowing I'm able to do something like this is very empowering.

### Graphics
Shader programming and shaders in gerneal are a new concept to me. I've learned how to do simple shaders and to use existing shader code to modify it for my needs. I'm excited to learn more about it in the next term and I hope I'll get to a level where I can create a shader from scratch that is as interesting as the two I used for my project.
