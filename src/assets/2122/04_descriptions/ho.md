# FinalProject.README

With this project, my main goal was to learn more about the inner workings of 3D graphics and experiment with building up interesting visuals through code. I also wanted to form a bridge between my interests in audio recording and my new knowledge in the world of graphics programming. In the process, I took a few twists and turns, but ended up with this final piece.

I started off with the audio part, in familiar waters. I’ve been interested in collecting exotic types of microphones for some time ( a dangerous interest for sure), and I had recently come across some electromagnetic microphones by a microphone maker in Bratislava, Slovakia (LOM), and I was keen to try them out. We were stuck inside, so I started by recording the various electronic devices and circuits using these microphones. I found that often these sound sources produced quite rhythmic and distorted tones - perfect for some Musique concrète. I found that transformers and power supplies produced great rhythmic material, while routers and phones produced step and hold tones. I also went out and recorded outside, where I found trains produced some great material (a modern version of Pierre Schaeffer’s "*[Étude aux chemins de fer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinq_%C3%A9tudes_de_bruits)*"?). I pulled the sounds into Ableton, and slowed them down to human-level timescales, and started building instruments from the sounds. For this task, I used Izotope’s Iris 2, Trash 2, Vital, and Ableton’s built in plugins. Most of the sounds in the track are built from the electromagnetic recordings.

As for the graphics part, I had originally imagined an abstract space scene, with imagery of solitary astronauts floating among desaturated planets in my moodboard. However, as I recorded the audio, I realized that the generative qualities of these scenes may be rather limited, and my moodboard later in the process reflected a more pared down, even more abstract outer space scene, with quasars being generated by audio waveforms, with a lot of sine waves, polar coordinates and perlin noise inspirations. My final version of the sketch was inspired by the updated moodboard with some additions. In researching ways to implement the code, I came across the aptly named “super formula” - a discovery by Johan Gielis in the year 2000, which can surprisingly create a huge number of shapes, in 2D and, in a modified form, in 3D by just changing 6 variables in the equation. I was intrigued and decided to pursue implementing it in p5. I connected the graphics and audio parts by modulating the values of these variables using the audio signals, resulting in some very interesting emergent behavior. In some ways, this magic formula connects to the mathematical side of the audio I was recording, in that seemingly very complex and varied phenomena can be described and broken down into a relatively elegant looking formula (or maybe they’re all just sine waves after all...).
