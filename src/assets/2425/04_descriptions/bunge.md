# Echoes of Space: Filmuni in Sound & Form

## Concept and idea:

The idea behind this project was to explore how people interact and use with the building. On one
hand, I collected sound samples from various scenarios that occur within and around the building.
These included sounds of doors opening, the microwave in use, footsteps on the floor, toilets flushing,
hands being washed, and even the act of approaching the building itself. I also incorporated the sound
of the S7 Bahn, which, for me, is an integral part of the experience of being a student at Filmuni.
On the other hand, I wanted to highlight the "core" of the building, focusing primarily on its materials
and patterns. My goal was to create an abstract visualization of the space, centering the design
around the iconic red staircase of Building 6. I integrated a metal grid reminiscent of the handrail
around the staircase, a V-shaped mirror reflecting the mirrored pillars outside Building 6, and added
plants and earthy elements to enhance the composition. In the background, I included the grid-like
structure of the building’s exterior windows, along with metal elements and concrete pillars, to further
emphasize its architectural essence.

My process was as follows:

• I collected and generated inspirational images for my idea and began using the 3D software
Maya to recreate a similar arrangement of objects. <br>
• In parallel, I recorded sound extracts of people—mainly myself and my fellow students—
interacting with and using the building.<br>
• I rendered both elements separately, saving them as sound.wav and scene.maya files, then
combined them in After Effects.<br>
• In After Effects, I applied color correction to the scene, as it didn’t quite match the initial Maya
rendering.<br>
