# Filmuni (placeholder title)

**Concept and Idea**

For my final project, I created a 3D scene paired with a self-composed musical piece. The theme "Filmuni" inspired me to construct a speculative model that represents the university in a unique and unexpected way. Drawing inspiration from Transformers, which have always been a showcase of the possibilities of CGI, I decided to create a Transformer-like creature built from architectural elements of Filmuni. The aggressive and powerful design of this entity reflects the intensity of the final weeks of working on various university projects.

Initially, I composed a soundscape using recordings collected within the university. However, as someone with prior experience in music production, I experimented extensively throughout the project, developing multiple tracks using VCV Rack and spatial sound techniques. Additionally, I participated privately in a public music production contest, which resulted in a more aggressive track that aligned perfectly with the ferocious nature of my 3D scene. Given the synergy between the visuals and the high-energy music, I chose this track to accompany my final animation.

**Technical Choices**

3D Modeling: The Transformer-like creature was constructed from architectural elements of Filmuni, integrating detailed textures and mechanical movement to enhance realism.

Texturing: Part of the textures were created in Substance Painter to achieve high-detail surface designs.

Rigging: An IK rig was created for the creature to enable dynamic and realistic movement.

Rendering: Lighting and camera movement were carefully planned to emphasize the dynamism of the transformation and the imposing presence of the character.

Sound Design & Mixing: While I initially worked with university sound recordings, my final choice was a track from my personal contest participation, as it better complemented the energy of the visuals.

**Software & Tools Used:**

3D Modeling & Animation: Cinema4D

Texturing: Substance Painter

Sound Design & Mixing: Ableton

Video Editing & Compositing: After Effects

**Learnings**

This project allowed me to experiment extensively with both sound and visuals, strengthening my understanding of audiovisual composition. Working on a structured, dynamic 3D animation provided deeper insights into lighting, camera work, and rendering optimizations. On the sound side, exploring spatial mixing techniques and experimenting with VCV Rack expanded my creative workflow. Additionally, the decision to pivot from my initial concept to a more aggressive audiovisual approach reinforced the importance of adaptability in creative projects.
