# A forest being born

The concept for my Filmuni sound is an abstraction of a flying journey that I imagined taking into account the physical space of the Uni and the abstract idea of cinema as something central to the university for all the people who inhabit it.
<br>
The journey starts in the surrounding nature of the University, there is some wind and birds and we can hear a film projector in the distance and we get closer and closer to it. We get inside the University and while we get closer to the source of the film projector we can listen to metallic stairs, steps, people speaking until the film projector is the main sound we perceive. Little by little we are moving away again until the projector fades away and we hear the birds and the wind again, to give an idea of a loop.
<br>
The Filmuni is a transforming place for me, where the concrete world that we perceive on a daily basis is reimagined and moves us to new perspectives where realism and imagination cohabit.
