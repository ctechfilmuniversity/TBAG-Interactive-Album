For my final project, I drew inspiration from the winter garden at the university. Despite the overall industrial architecture of the campus, I've always found this space to be incredibly calming. It became the foundation for my piece, which explores the idea that the university is incomplete without the people who inhabit it. To convey this, I focused on the ivy that climbs the universityâ€™s walls. I designed the ivy to grow in response to the presence of human sounds, such as whispers and the sound of footsteps on gravel. I also intentionally made the camera movement feel erratic, adding a sense of human presence. To enhance this effect, I incorporated a vignette in DaVinci, creating a spotlight-like effect reminiscent of a torch. This emphasizes the idea that the ivy grows only when a person is near.
