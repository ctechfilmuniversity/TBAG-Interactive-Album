From Tree to Wood to Fire: In this project, I aimed to create music that's not just nice to listen to, but also rich in texture and depth. Avoiding the sharp, sometimes jarring sounds of traditional synthesizers, I decided to explore the theme of wood. This choice was driven by a desire to craft a sound that’s both unique and soothing. The narrative arc of my piece takes the listener from the tranquil presence of a tree in nature, through the act of it being cut down, the transformation of its wood, and finally, to the wood's consumption by fire.


***The Music:***
I blended mostly internet-sourced samples with my a few own recordings, capturing authentic sounds like the clatter of wood pieces and the groan of creaking floorboards. The track begins in quietude, marked by the gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze. A serene melody introduced by a wind chime gradually gives way to the ominous tones of a flute, signaling an impending change. The rhythmic chopping of wood follows, commanding attention with its methodical cadence, culminating in the dramatic crash of the tree's fall. The soundscape then evolves, moving away from the natural to highlight the utility of wood through the percussive sounds of wood impacts, the squeak of floorboards, and the shutting of doors, establishing a new rhythm. The piece reaches its zenith with the engulfing sound of burning wood, which slowly obliterates all other sounds, leaving a silent void where the tree once stood, now reduced to ashes. As a DAW I used Reaper to stitch together the samples as well as Garage Band to make use of the Live Loops to help me get some form of a melody, mixing together apple loops and my own audios.

***Visuals:*** To visually represent this auditory journey, I drew inspiration from an abstract mood board. Influenced by the structure of wooden sculptures, I used the audio frequencies to animate their position, rotation, and velocity, giving the impression of a wooden form suspended in air, alive with movement. The visual transition from the vibrant life of a tree to the desolation of ash is marked by a color shift from lush green to muted grey, further accentuated by the gradual disappearance of leaves. At the heart of the sculpture, a pulsating sphere moves in harmony with the music, symbolizing the life force of the tree. As the narrative progresses to the finale of fire, this sphere takes on a fiery red hue, mirroring the transformation of wood into flame, with the movements of the wood evolving from the chaotic freedom of nature to the structured rhythm imposed by human interaction.


***Technical execution:***
The visualization was made with threeJs, utilizing the audio analyser's frequency data to animate objects in the scene. Specifically, the glowing sphere and a collection of sticks (representing the wood theme) are animated. Each stick's rotation and position are altered in real-time, with specific changes governed by different parts of the frequency spectrum. For instance, lower frequencies might cause the sticks to rotate slowly, creating a more grounded, earthy visualization, while higher frequencies might result in quicker, more erratic movements. As the music's volume increases, the sphere expands, and as the volume decreases, the sphere contracts. This visual pulsation mimics the natural rhythm of a heartbeat or the ebb and flow of life energy.

***Intention:***
My main goal was to create a piece of music concrete that's actually nice to listen to, setting it apart from the often noisy and harsh tracks you might find in this genre. I wanted to craft a story that had a clear shift in sound. Being someone who's really into nature, which influences a lot of my work, I chose a tree as the central figure of my story. The idea was to capture the sad journey of a tree from standing tall in nature to being cut down by humans and eventually burned, all through sound and visuals. I aimed to make something visually engaging with Three.js, trying to match what I can usually do with 3D software, while also pushing myself to learn a new programming language and not just rely on the 3D tools I’m familiar with.
