## Final Project for TBAG

## "THERE IS NO TIME" - Maximilian Rueth



## Description

"THERE IS NO TIME" is a project that aims to create a cinematic, mysterious and escapist atmosphere. The cold, harsh environment of an arctic landscape, which at the same time represents a surreal beauty, is intended to create an unnatural, dream-like setting that has a certain hypnotic attraction. However, you shouldn't stay there too long, because the real world and its problems could catch up with you and time is running out. You have to act before it's too late.


## TECHNICAL CHOICES

### Audio


I decided to use the DAW "Reaper" to create the soundtrack. As it was my first time working with a DAW and I had never done any kind of audio production before, I had some difficulties with it at first. After learning a few basics and learning how to navigate it, it was fun to work with and I was able to get some good results. The soundtrack was created with audio tracks from [freesound](https://freesound.org/) and a few tracks I recorded myself, which I then mixed and edited in Reaper.



### Visuals

For the 3D visualisation, I decided to work with Blender and Geometry Nodes. Having never done any kind of audio visualisation before, I was keen to explore the possibilities that Blender has to offer in this regard. I found that there was huge potential in creating visualisations with Geometry Nodes, a feature of Blender that allows the creation, manipulation and modification of geometry using a graphical node system that I had also never used before. Even though there was quite a learning curve at the beginning, I'm happy with the results I have achieved and look forward to using it even more in the future.



## ARTISTIC INTENTION

My overall goal was to capture the dreamlike, escapist but also pressing and harsh atmosphere of my concept. 

The audio in the beginning should create this surreal and uneasy feeling, which is represented by the arctic wind and the sirens in the the background. Although the sounds seem eerie and threatening at first, it then transitions into a more dreamlike, beautiful and hypnotic state that fully engages the senses and consciousness. But this state does not last long, as the heartbeat and the ticking of the clock show. Then, suddenly, a transformation takes place through the use of glitch-like sounds, transforming the soundtrack into a hasty, fast-paced techno track. This is intended to symbolise the return to the real world with its often time-pressured situation, which is also caused by the fact that we let too much time pass and suddenly no longer have enough of it.

For the visual part, I wanted to portray this cold arctic environment as a background to give the overall scene a kind of frame. The centre of the whole scene is an audio reactive sphere that reacts to the different facets of the soundtrack. It is surrounded by a more organic-looking sphere that is meant to represent the life and state of mind of the person immersed in this environment, reacting primarily to the heartbeat and ticking that occur in the song. The wavy particles surrounding the sphere should behave like the surface of a lake: most of the time it remains calm, but as soon as there is activity and many things happen at once, it becomes very busy and restless. The abstract patterns on the landscape are intended to reinforce the dreamlike atmosphere and are an allusion to the Northern Lights.




## Reflection on the 3D tool used

I decided to use Blender as a 3D tool. My reasons are the following:

- I want to get more professional in that software
- audio visualisation is something I've never done before in Blender 
- really keen on learning more about GeoNodes in Blender -> I've never used them before, but currently learning the basics 
- wanted to create a polished piece which I can use in my portfolio

## CONCLUSION + LEARNINGS

It was a really great experience for me to work on this project. Even though I played the violin a few years ago, it was still quite difficult to create my own soundtrack that sounds good in a certain way. Having never been serious about sound design before, working with a DAW (in my case REAPER) was definitely a challenge and I had a lot of difficulties at first. But after a few sessions of just experimenting with the programme and different audio tracks, I was eventually able to produce something I liked. Of course it's far from perfect, but I'm happy with how the final track turned out. The combination of Blender and Geometry Nodes for visual design was a really interesting but challenging experience, but it was also a great learning opportunity. I learnt a lot of new things through this course and definitely got a good insight into track production, which makes me appreciate professional sound design even more! I definitely got some new ideas for future projects!
