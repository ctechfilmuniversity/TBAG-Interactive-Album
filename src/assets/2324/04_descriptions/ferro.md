# City(e)scape

## Concept Idea

City(e)scape aims to capture the relentless sonic impulse to which we are subjected. *Can we ever truly experience silence?* 

It's a journey from overwhelming chaos to serene calm. Initially suffocating and discordant, saturated with noise and voices, it evolves into tranquillity and peace.



## Technical Choices

### Audio

The audio is made up of three main groups of sounds: the sounds of the city, my own thoughts and the sounds of breathing. I recorded the thoughts and most of the city sounds myself. I then manipulated and arranged them using Reaper. 

At the beginning of the music, the goal was to have an unpleasant  composition of the  city sounds and the thoughts. Both the city sounds and the thoughts are manipulated with effects. The city noices are set to different volume levels, while the thoughts are set to different pan levels. 

The transition to tranquillity begins with a tinnitus. At this point the city noise disappears and the sound of nature and breathing can be finally heard. I've chosen this method because I've found that listening to my own breathing can help me to relax. 




### Visual 

The visual idea of the project was to create a cityscape to escape from. I worked with Three.js and created a box composition that could be reminiscent of a city. 

I wanted all the different components of my audio track to have different effects on the visual, so I exported them individually.

The boxes are animated in height and react to the frequencies of the city sounds. Low, mid and high frequencies trigger different boxes. 

As for the thoughts, I realised that they sometimes change the way we see things, so I wanted their sounds to distort the external reality. I've used a glitch effect that appears based on the average frequency of the thought track. 

When the tinnitus arrives, the city disappears and a particle system appears around a sphere, animated with the sounds of the breathings.

## Artistic Intention 

In my project I wanted to explore the concepts of chaos and silence and how they relate to anxiety and relaxation. We are constantly under sound pressure, overloaded with sound impulses that can be both external, especially if we live in a big city, and also internal, our own thoughts. 

My aim was to immediately immerse the listener in an uncomfortable and suffocating sonic environment, which grows in intensity until it's too much and you just want to escape. 

How do we feel when it's too much? What can we do when we feel suffocated? How does the reality change around us? At some point we can't recognise it anymore, everything goes blank. But if we concentrate on our own breathing, we may be able to come back to a calm reality.
