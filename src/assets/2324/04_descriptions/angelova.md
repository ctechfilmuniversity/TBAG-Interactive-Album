# Space encounters

## The story

<img src="./img/space-travellers-0.png" width=1000></img>

_Space encounters._

_Fragments of a typical day in this Universe._

The _Whisperer_ is doing its usual business - making sure that all space creatures are well trained, so that they can help and guide space travellers passing by. Therefore, the two adventurous friends - the _Spirit_ and the _Bird_ will be safely guided by the _Space eggs_. These little guys always know all the ways.

*The spirit* is very courageous and has been travelling around different *spaces* in different universes for quite some time now. Therefore, he is a well-known visitor almost everywhere he goes. Although he met *the bird* not so long ago, and although the _Bird_ cannot really be described as someone experienced at going a lot here and there, they almost immediately got along very well. Since then, they have been adventuring together.

The _Whisperer_ is a very powerful inhabitant of this exact place in the Universe.
His abilities are to tame all kinds of _animals_ and _plants_.
Did you see how he summoned the _Space eggs_?
And how tamed the usually a bit mischievous _Monster plants_ looked?
His Magic Wand is his most powerful weapon.
Moreover, the magical power that every _Whisperer_ possesses, has a distinct color, which can be seen on the Magic Wand, and the special Magic Eyes on his hat, which serve as his power source.

## Technical execution

All scene elements and all creatures are created entirely with _three.js_.
The animation is put together, using _Theater.js_.
The sound is composed by me in _Reaper_, and is a mixture of different types of tracks - some recorded by me with the virtual MIDI, some downloaded from [freesound](https://freesound.org/), and some prompted with [Stable Audio](https://www.stableaudio.com/).

## Intention

I like stories and with this project, I wanted to try and create one of my own.
It is inspired by different cartoon animations, that I have watched as a kid or that I still watch.
I really enjoyed the whole process of creating the characters and thinking about their backgrounds.
I also tried to put together a representative audio for the story. The idea is that it should add another layer to the characters, supporting their individual characteristics. For example, the Whisperer has this mysterious feeling, whereas the space eggs are the very funny little guys, super energetic, playful, positive and very helpful as well.
I tried to show it with both their moves - just cheerfully dancing in space - and the music when they are on display.
I also spent a lot of time on the camera animation, adjusting its position and field of view for the different frames. I wanted for the scene to give this feeling of floating around in the big space. Another effect I was trying to achieve is the camera to follow the creatures.

The overall feeling of my project should be similar to an intro of a cartoon show.
Or at least this is what I was imaging while working on it, and what I hoped for the final result.

_Notes:_ When starting the project, an information pop-up will appear. This is part of _Theater.js_, so just click _OK_ on it and the animation will start. For the project description in the album, only [__The Story__](#the-story) section is relevant.
