Playhead
Playhead is a virtual directional microphone that allows users to pick up sound fragments from a distance. Each sound fragment is one second long and part of a music track. By scanning these fragments, users can choose to either listen to the entire song in its original linear fashion or dive into a small segment to deconstruct its elements in a non-linear way.

The sound fragments are distributed in the form of simple cubes, each carrying a small layer of the song at that second. It takes an average of 5-15 cubes per second to hear all elements of the song at a particular moment, meaning the song consists of hundreds of cubes.

The layout of the cubes in 3D space follows the structure of the song, which I projected onto a grid. The grid is organized by instruments, frequencies, and time.

The AR aspect allows users to hear the sounds spatially, with each fragment becoming louder or quieter depending on the distance. The directional microphone enables scanning the cubes from any distance and grouping them into new clusters in a non-linear way.

Users can also find some “natural” sounds hidden in the village below the floating cubes.
